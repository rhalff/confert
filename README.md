Require and convert config files of any type

This module serves a very simple purpose, it loads a config fileaA

As a bonus you can leave it up to the user of your program what type
of config file to use.

## Installation
```
$ npm install confert
```

## Usage
```javascript
var config = require('confert')('my_config');
```

This will look for the following files config.json, config.ini, config.xml

If you already know what the config type is, you can load these modules directly.
```javascript
var config = require('confert/yaml')('my_config');
var config = require('confert/ini')('my_config');
var config = require('confert/xml')('my_config');
```

But it takes away the flexibility of absorbing any config file.

### Options object

Right now only the xml module receives some options, these are directly taken
from xml2json:

Default values:
```javascript
var options = {
  sanitize: true,
  trim: true
};

var config = require('confert')('my_config', options);

```

For XML the root element is required, yet the name is always ignored.
