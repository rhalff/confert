Confert
=======

Require and convert config files of any type

This module serves a very simple purpose, it loads a config fileaA

As a bonus you can leave it up to the user of your program what type
of config file to use.

## Installation
```
$ npm install confert
```

## Usage
```javascript
var config = require('confert')('my_config');
```

This will look for the following files config.json, config.ini, config.xml

If you already know what the config type is, you can load these modules directly.
```javascript
var config = require('confert/yaml')('my_config');
var config = require('confert/ini')('my_config');
var config = require('confert/xml')('my_config');
```

But it takes away the flexibility of absorbing any config file.

### Options object

Right now only the xml module receives some options, these are directly taken
from xml2json:

```javascript
// Default values:
var options = {
  sanitize: true,
  trim: true
};

// Tries to load any extension, might .xml be found those options will be used.
var config = require('confert')('my_config', options);

```

For XML the root element is required, yet the name is always ignored.

Example Configurations:

XML:
```xml
<config>
  <scope>global</scope>
  <database>
    <user>dbuser</user>
    <password>dbpassword</password>
    <name>test</name>
  </database>
  <paths>
    <default>
      <datadir>/var/lib/data</datadir>
      <array>first value</array>
      <array>second value</array>
      <array>third value</array>
    </default>
  </paths>
</config>
```

YAML:
```coffee
---
scope: global
database:
  user: dbuser
  password: dbpassword
  name: test
paths:
  default:
    datadir: /var/lib/data
    array:
      - 'first value'
      - 'second value'
      - 'third value'
```

INI:
```ini
; this comment is being ignored
scope = global

[database]
user = dbuser
password = dbpassword
name = test

[paths.default]
datadir = /var/lib/data
array[] = first value
array[] = second value
array[] = third value
```

All of the above will produce the exact same data structure:

```json
{
  "scope": "global",
  "database": {
    "user": "dbuser",
    "password": "dbpassword",
    "name": "test"
  },
  "paths": {
    "default": {
      "datadir": "/var/lib/data",
      "array": [
        "first value",
        "second value",
        "third value"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
